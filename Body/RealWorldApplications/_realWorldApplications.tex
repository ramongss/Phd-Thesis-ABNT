\chapter{Real World Applications} \label{chap:realworld}

This chapter presents three applications addressing the \ac{RQ}s, specific objectives, and contributions of this thesis.

The first application is based on \citeonline{dasilva2020Forecasting} entitled ``Forecasting Brazilian and American COVID-19 cases based on \ac{AI} coupled with exogenous climatic variables'' and published in the \textit{Chaos, Solitons \& Fractals} Journal (v.139, June 2020, 110027, \url{https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chaos.2020.110027}). This article mainly explores using signal decomposition methods in time series forecasting.

Next, the second application is based on \citeonline{dasilva2021Novel} entitled ``A novel decomposition-ensemble learning framework for multi-step ahead wind energy forecasting'' and published in \textit{Energy} Journal (v.216, February 2021, 119174, \url{https://doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2020.119174}). This application aims to combine signal decomposition methods and a stacking-ensemble learning approach. This research is an extension of a sequence of articles that started with \citeonline{moreno2019Very} entitled ``Very short-term wind energy forecasting based on stacking ensemble'' exploring the use of \ac{STACK}, and \citeonline{dasilva2020Wind} entitled ``Wind energy multi-step ahead forecasting based on variational mode decomposition'' using signal decomposition methods to forecast renewable energy time series.

Last, the third application is based on \citeonline{dasilva2022Multistep} entitled ``Multi-step short-term wind speed forecasting based on multi-stage decomposition coupled with stacking-ensemble learning approach'' and published in the \textit{International Journal of Electrical Power \& Energy Systems} Journal (v.143, 108504, December 2022, \url{https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijepes.2022.108504}). This case aims to apply the multi-stage decomposition strategy coupled with the \ac{STACK} approach. Also, this study was an extension of all applications cited before. Moreover, this forecasting framework was inspired by \citeonline{moreno2020Multistep} entitled ``Multi-step wind speed forecasting based on hybrid multi-stage decomposition model and long short-term memory neural network'' and \citeonline{dasilva2021Multistep} entitled ``Multi-step wind speed forecasting based on multi-stage decomposition approach''. Both studies applied only the multi-stage decomposition strategy, which motivated the author to combine the \ac{STACK} approach to enhance the forecasting framework. Figure \ref{fig:case_studies} summarizes the structure of the applications presented in this chapter.
